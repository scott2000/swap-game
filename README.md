Swap
====

Earn new high scores and unlock new colors by connecting similar tiles.

If you can't connect any tiles, you can swap tiles to make new possibilities.
Swapping tiles uses energy that replenishes as you play.
The game gets harder as you score more points and more red tiles that cannot
be swapped appear, limiting your moves.

Unlock new colors by reaching high scores and connecting extra long chains of
tiles. If you unlock enough colors, a special challenge mode will be unlocked
with a much higher difficulty.
